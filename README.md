This repository holds the things I have been doing in [CodeForces](www.codeforces.com).
Click here to have an overview of my records in [Codeforces Profile](http://codeforces.com/profile/facebook-calvin)

As you can see, this repository may witness my growing trajectory from a coding beginner to someone else.

Hope I can grow from 0 lines to over **100,000** lines before my 22th birthday, which could be a great milestone.

At last, God bless the World, including you and me.
