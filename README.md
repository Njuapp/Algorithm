As Emerson has put it, the only way to go is to follow heart, doing something that could finally lead to self-transformation.

### Explanation for the commit message
  Every of my file has been commited with a submission-time rank and a line count at that time.
As you can see, this repository may witness my growing trajectory from a coding beginner to someone else.

  Hope I can grow from 0 lines to over 100,000 lines before my 22th birthday, which could be a great milestone.
  
  At last, God bless the World, including you and me.
